# QLearning

### What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?

  Q Learning is a reinforcement learning algorithim that uses its current state to take the best course of action. Given inifite exploration time, an     algorithim will be able to learn the optimal action based on its previous random actions. The Q in Q Learning stands for "quality" which denotes the "quality" or usefulness of action to achieving an end goal. The second part of Q Learning literally means that the algorithm learns from its actions as it explores.

### What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?

  RL is a machine learning training method. It is based on the idea that an algorithm will learn based on rewarding desirable actions or punishing ones that are not. An agent will switch between states by taking actions. Based on the result of the action, the action will be assigned either a positive value (good) or negative value (bad) that will inform the action of the agent next time. RL is one of the main three ML learning models. 

### What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?

Being model-free means that Q Learning does not need a model of the environment to work. It can tackle problems without knowing the parameters of the environment to learn the best course of action.

### What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)

I'm not sure when it is used most often but last summer I built some lego robots that used Q-Learning to travel parallel to a wall (super advanced ik..)!
